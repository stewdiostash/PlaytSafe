## __Description__
Play't Safe is an app designed to help you make sure you don't kill your guests with your food or with boredom!

With so many existing, and  emerging allergies, it can be stressful to cook for guests..._especially_ ones that you'd like to see a _second_ time. Powered by [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) API and backed by the [Open Movie Database](https://www.omdbapi.com/), Play't Safe helps you choose a meal and a movie for a night in. It even offers wine pairings for certain meals. 

Just follow the simple prompts to ensure that you find the right meal to impress.
